# RUNTOOLS user manual
## Forewords:

  If you read this manual is that you probably have successfully installed and compiled a NEMO configuration, using DCM ! (to make it short you have a `nemo4.exe` in the `$PDIR/RUN_<CONFIG>/<CONFIG>-<CASE>/EXE/` directory, corresponding to your settings (code and cpp keys)). Ideally you are now only missing some runtime files to make your first run:  
 * the namelist files (for ocean, ice, passive tracers etc...)
 * the xml files used by XIOS for model output
 * data files such as initial conditions, domain configuration, atmospheric forcing etc...


  This document explains how to run a model configuration, installed and compiled with DCM.
